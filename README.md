## Data

Three sources of data are used for the semantics and the phonology components of this study:

### Semantics

* Pretrained GloVe vectors:

The word embeddings we use in this study can be obtained [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip).

### Phonology

The phonological transcriptions of the signs for the two languages come from two different sources:

* Original video data for American Sign Language (ASL) can be found at the University of Chicago's [Sign and Gesture Archive](https://saga.rcc.uchicago.edu/index.html). All requests to access this repository should be directed to [Diane Brentari](mailto:dbrentari.uchicago.edu)

* Original video data for British Sign Language (BSL) are from the videos available via public view at the [BSL SignBank] dictionary (https://bslsignbank.ucl.ac.uk/) (Fenlon et al., 2014).

*Fenlon, J., Cormier, K., Rentelis, R., Schembri, A., Rowley, K., Adam, R., et al. (2014). BSL SignBank: A lexical database and dictionary of British Sign Language*

* Phonological transcriptions of signs from these two sources are available to view in the repository.
